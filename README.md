The large generation of language models focuses on optimizing excellent reasoning, multi-task knowledge, and tools support.

### Introduction

**Ghost 7B Alpha** is a large language model fine-tuned from Mistral 7B, with a size of 7 billion parameters. The model was developed with the goal of optimizing reasoning ability, multi-task knowledge and supporting tool usage. The model works well with the main trained and optimized languages being English and Vietnamese.

Overall, the model is suitable when making a pretrained version so you can continue to develop the desired tasks, develop virtual assistants, perform features on tasks such as coding, translation, answering questions, creating documents, etc. It is truly an efficient, fast and extremely cheap open model.

### Notebooks

To make it easy for everyone to quickly experience the model through platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle. Weâ€™ve made these notebooks available so you can get started right away. See available notebooks with details [here](https://ghost-x.vercel.app/docs/notebooks/playground-with-ghost-7b-alpha/).

We offer notebooks with a wide selection of tools and platforms so you can easily get started. Here are some available options for you to try right now. Letâ€™s pick one to get started.

There are currently two language versions: English and Vietnamese. In each version, it will be almost the same. The content will include installation instructions and functions to help get started quickly with experiencing the model's text generation capabilities. In addition, it also provides examples with system prompts for each field so you can better understand them.
